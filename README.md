# Risperidone-Model
Parent-metabolite PBPK model of risperidone and its active metabolite 9-hydroxyrisperidone including CYP2D6 DGIs. 

# Repository files
Within this repository, we distribute a whole-body PBPK model of risperidone and its metabolite 9-hydroxyrisperidone. The model was originally developed by *Kneller et al.*[[1]](https://doi.org/10.1007/s40262-019-00793-x) and evaluated with additional profiles in this study. Additionally, the activity-score dependent metabolism of risperidone has been implemented.

For further details, quantitative model evaluation and extensive documentation please refer to [[2]](https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics14081734).
